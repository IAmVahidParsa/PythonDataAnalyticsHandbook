This handbook is organized into the various sections, and those themselves are organized by lesson within each chapter.


Resources include:

- Fully annotated Jupyter notebooks corresponding to the coding lessons.
- Any files we used during the coding lessons.
- Exercises for each chapter containing at least two files:
	- A Jupyter notebook with the questions.
	- A second Jupyter notebook with a fully annotated solution (you may have a different way of solving the problem and that's absolutely fine, as long as your code works, and is clear and easy to read).
	- if applicable, additional data files or materials needed to complete the exercises.
